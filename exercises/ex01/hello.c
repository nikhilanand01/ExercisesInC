/*
1. subq	$16, %rsp; movl	$5, (%rbp)

2. The amount of instructions and lines significantly decreases as some instructions are gone.

3. movl	$5, %es is added

4. Without optimization x and y get assigned values and y is printed.
   With optimization x and y arenâ€™t assigned but the value still gets printed?
   (Not really sure about this one)
